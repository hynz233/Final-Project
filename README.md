Summary:
Adequate social mobility is essential for the healthy development of a society. A large number of studies have shown that social mobility is related to multiple factors, and education is one of the most concerned. To study the relationship between education level and social mobility, we analyzed 12 US cities. We designed a scoring algorithm to evaluate the education level and social mobility of each city. We found that, overall, social mobility is positively related to education level.
